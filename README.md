# Zero Waste

Do you know how much waste you create in a day? Waste disposal has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, but how can we measure the amount of waste we create? Our goal is to design and compile a website that allows users to record the amount of waste they throw away each day and compare it to existing data to see how much waste reduction they should achieve. We first created a prototype design using Figma, and then implemented it through HTML, CSS and Java Script. In addition to the welcome page and login page, our website also has a personalized dashboard for users, where they can log into their accounts, record their daily waste and see how they compare to the exsisting data.



## How to Setup and Run

In order to setup the project, please proceed as follows:

```bash
  npm install my-project
```

After successful installation use the following command to run the project:

```bash
  npm run
```
## Examples

You can see a brief overview of how to use the main functionality below

```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

function App() {
  return <Component />
}
```
